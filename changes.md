# ðŸ”– Release v1.0.1 â€“ Stable Portfolio Release

This is the **first stable release** of my personal portfolio site.  
As mentioned earlier â€“ **this is a static project**, so don't expect frequent updates or maintenance.

## âœ… Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed minor linter issues and security flaws (e.g., forgot to disconnect `IntersectionObservers` ðŸ˜…).
- Removed the **Skills** component â€“ it was slow due to fetching, compiling, and calculating percentages.
- Added **skeleton loaders** to all sections for a cleaner and more professional look.
- Introduced a new **Tech Stacks** section replacing Skills â€” it showcases tools and technologies I'm familiar with.
- Enhanced **About** section:
  - Improved the typewriter effect.
  - Now the next paragraph appears **earlier** (without waiting for typing to fully complete), but stays **faded** until the first paragraph finishes rendering â€” improves pacing without hurting the experience.
