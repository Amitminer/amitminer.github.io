  "longDescription": "DocsX is a blazing-fast, AI-enhanced documentation and tutorial platform built for developers who are tired of scattered, outdated, and clunky doc systems. It combines a Rust backend with a modern Next.js frontend to offer a smooth experience for writing, exploring, and sharing technical content.\n\nWriters can create rich Markdown-based docs and tutorials, enhanced by Google AI summaries. Readers get instant full-text search, community interaction features, and fast load times. With secure authentication via Clerk and JWT, built-in asset support, and custom slugs for sharing — DocsX aims to be the dev-focused Notion + Dev.to hybrid.\n\nIt also exposes a powerful REST API for content, assets, and user interaction, and is structured with scalable deployment in mind. Although the backend may be offline due to hosting limits, it's fully open-source and ready to self-host.",
